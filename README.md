# Angry-Bears
Python Game using pygame

Done as part of a transverse project at Efrei Paris, in L1.

Like JetPack Joyride, the goal of the game is to catch the fish by moving the bear. Use the space bar to make it go up, it goes down by gravity. 

However, beware of orcas, nets and rocks.
The goal of the game is to go as far as possible, which increases the player's score.
In addition, there is a wide variety of bears that you can unlock by spending fish, the game's currency, in the store.

# Prerequisites
